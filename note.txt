just a command I used often
for copy paste 

cd C:\Users\suwijack\Desktop\year4 sem2\team software project\NearBuy\backend

test_api.bat (no need anymore, we automated testing in tests/) 

python -m app.main
python -m pytest tests
python -m pytest tests/test_websocket.py -v

lmao The WebSocket server runs on the same port (5000) as your Flask app
